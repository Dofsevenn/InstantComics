## Links to sites I used as inspiration or borrowed code:
* Convert image string to UIImage:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPR-LB2tYUU
* How to make different background colors for dark mode and light mode: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59694589/change-background-color-when-dark-mode-turns-on-in-swiftui

## Shortcuts that I didn't have time to fix
* Had to set the "Allow Arbitrary Loads" to "Yes" under "App Transport Security Settings" to get the api to work, because the api link is not https. I found out that this is not a good solution, but I couldn't get the "Exception Domains" to work so I could have the "Allow Arbitrary Loads" to "No"
